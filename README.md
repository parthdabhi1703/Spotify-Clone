# Spotify-Clone
This initial learning project is a responsive front-end clone of Spotify, built entirely with HTML and CSS. It recreates Spotify’s clean, modern look with a focus on responsive layout, from grid-based playlists to stylish navigation—all without JavaScript. Perfect for showcasing core HTML/CSS skills.
